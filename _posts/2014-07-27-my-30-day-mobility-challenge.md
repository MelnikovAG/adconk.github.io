## Intro

Hi, I'm Andrew, a software engineer by trade, cofounder of a fitness tech business called Routeam. Although I'm generally on the healthy side of life, I was sporadic at exercising. I found my mood and energy would fluctuate with days of high physical activity vs days I was sitting and coding. For the  last 30 days, I decided to try a short workout every single day, and create a baseline of movement, no matter what else I was doing that day.

## Challenge

* Pick 10 daily exercises
* Do them in the morning, first thing, no excuses
* Go for 30 days and see how things went

## Prereqs

* Research 10 exercises that cover the major muscle groups
* Keep a journal of days completed
* I personally used [10 Daily Exercises on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playsimple.fitnessapp&hl=en) as it did all these things for me

* Optional: a few motivating wakeup songs to begin the workout.  My favorite was "Here comes the Sun" by The Beatles on vinyl.

I did it! (of course). Ranging from June 26th to July 26th, I did 10 daily exercises for 1 month straight.  The biggest improvement I noticed was how much quicker my body was reacting to the world.  My legs felt increasingly mobile and energetic compared to the past several years.  My knees and back would crack a bit less each subsequent morning.  My mind was also sharper and ready to go.  I was most surprised that such a light workout could have such profound effect on my lifestyle.

### Week 1
___Mood: Nostalgic___.  I was starting a new adventure with a high amount of motivation.  I began on the medium setting of my workout app, and then immediately changed it to easy on day 1.  It was more important to me to do this every day, than to get a great workout in on one single day.  

### Week 2
___Mood: Focused___.  I was still thinking about the workout, and I did not want to miss any. There was fear that I would skip one, so the psychology of that provoked extra mental energy before workouts. Motivation remained high, although I did have one drinking night that made one morning particularly challenging.

### Week 3
___Mood: Bored___. At this point, I was kind of bored with the whole 10 daily exercises bit.  I struggled with morale and ambition, but was able to keep things going, given the short time commitment of the workout and my connection with a long term desire. In retrospect, this is probably the riskiest timeframe that might have derailed my challenge.

### Week 4 & 5
___Mood: Happy___. The finish line was near, I was thinking less about the workout before hand, and doing more automatically. The excitement picked back up, in anticipation of achieving my goal.  Even more so, about what would come next, as I was already witnessing body health improvements.  

## Conclusion

I'm excited with my new found mobility in exchange for 10-12 minutes every morning. My plan for the next 30 days is to increase my workout time commitment, and switch back and forth between 10 Daily Exercises and another app called "12 Minute Athlete".  My intention is to continue to strengthen my weakest areas, particularly: upper tights, gluts, and abs.  

If you made it this far and want to connect with me, please do!  If you're not intentionally doing several movements a day already, I'll say from experience, start now and your body will thank you and reward you in 30 days.  Imagine if we continue to do this for a year, or 5 years? I don't want to speak for everyone, but I bet I'll be winning a lot of Tri-Hackathons.
