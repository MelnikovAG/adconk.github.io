Often times, when weâ€™re at our desks working long hours, we challenge our minds but forget about the attention we should give to our physical bodies. Dustin and I spent a [half day at UberOffices](https://routeam.com/classes/1309) helping members practice healthy productivity through the Pomodoro technique.




  What is the Pomodoro Technique? Its a time management philosophy where you decide on tasks to address and begin work on them for 25 minute increments of time. For more information, see here:
